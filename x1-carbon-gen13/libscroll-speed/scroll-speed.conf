# Non-linear touchpad scroll curve (macOS-like)

# The transform: f(d) = base-speed × scroll-cap × tanh((|d| / scroll-cap) ^ ramp-softness)
#
#   Small delta (slow scroll) → output suppressed by softness exponent
#   Large delta (fast scroll) → output → base-speed × scroll-cap (capped)
#
# With defaults (base-speed=0.80, scroll-cap=10, ramp-softness=3.0):
#   delta= 1 → 0.008        inertial tail — nearly silent
#   delta= 2 → 0.064 (3%)   inertial — strongly suppressed
#   delta= 5 → 0.99  (20%)  VSCode slow scroll — preserved
#   delta=10 → 6.08  (61%)  medium-fast
#   delta=20 → 8.00  (40%)  fast → capped
#   maximum  → 8.00         absolute ceiling (= base-speed × scroll-cap)

# Overall sensitivity for slow/precise scrolling.
# Higher = faster base scroll.
base-speed=0.80

# Soft speed cap (scroll-value units).
# Lower = more aggressive cap on fast scrolling.
# Max output = base-speed × scroll-cap

# Ramp softness exponent (1.0 = linear start, >1 = gentler).
# Higher values suppress initial speed — tames kinetic scrolling in
# browsers while keeping medium/fast speed unchanged.
ramp-softness=3.0

# Mouse wheel linear factor (1.0 = unchanged)
